# Extended-Arduino-Board-configurations
(Experimental!) Added Atmega16u2 to the standard arduino boards configs

I've added the ATmega16u2 to the standard Arduino IDEs board collection. I can't guarantee anything as it's just a first try.

note: I've used the pin Config from: https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2
